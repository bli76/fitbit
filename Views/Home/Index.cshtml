            <h3>What is FitPETZ?</h3>
            <p>
                FitPETZ is a kid-friendly, inclusive, competitive exercise app where users can earn in-game currency to redeem
                rewards through exercises,
                and the best part is that you get a pet!
            </p>
            <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
            <p>
                The multiplayer aspect allows users to interact with friends while going on walks.
                The app contains a world map feature that displays the location and current activity of your friends so you can
                complete exercises together.
            </p>

        <div class = "petokens column">
            <h3>Petokens</h3>
            <p>
                The in-game currency, called Petokens, can be earned through exercise challenges that can be completed
                individually or in teams.
                Petokens can be redeemed for sponsored items, in-game customizations, and virtual pets at store locations
                scattered throughout the surrounding area.
                Virtual pets can serve as exercise companions as you complete challenges.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                FitPETZ addresses the lack of accommodations for the disabled community in other exercise apps by including
                white noise,
                voice-overs, and a four-quadrant interface for those with cognitive and visual impairments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to increase overall motivation to exercise, because <b>your next fitness trainer isn’t human, it’s a
                    pet!</b>
            </p>
